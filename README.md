Topic/Title:

Automated Pet Feed

Problems and Issues:

There are times when pet owners are too busy or is away from home and unable to feed their pets regularly. This can cause problems if their pets are not fed regularly, which is a huge problem especially for pet owners who tend to travel a lot. As such this project allows pets to be fed regularly, without having their owners to do so daily.

Design:

The automated pet feed with consist of a sensor and mechanism attached to the feeder. The sensor will check for the weight of the food/water bowl regularly. The weight of the bowl would weigh less if the water and food has been eaten, and would weight heavier if they are untouched. Once the sensors detect the weight of the food/water bowl to be less than it is supposed to be, it would then cause the dispenser to release food/water unto the bowl.

Team Responsibility :

Devent - Determine the hardware and type of sensor we need for the system.
